# Maths
I'm very much self-taught when it comes to maths, so excuse the obvious definitions, and hopefully there are no errors

## Algebra
- Use of arithmetic expressions, eg + - / x
- Use of equations, eg 1 + 2 *=* 3
- Maths using letters to represent variables, eg: 2x - y = 9
- Functions, eg f(x) = 2x

## Trigonometry
- Maths about relationship between triangle angles and sides 
- Sin, Cos, Tan functions and their inverse
- SOH CAH TOA , eg Sin(angle) = Opposite / Hypotenuse (angle in radians)
- Full circle is 2 * PI _radians_ units

## Algebra 2
- Polynomials arithmetic
- Complex Numbers (Real & Imaginary) - picture them on a real and imaginary 2D cartesian coordinate system, to map them to a circle.
- Imaginary number _i_ (i = i, i² = -1, i³ = -i, i⁴ = 1)

## Calculus
- The maths studying _change_
- Differentials (rate of change) & Integration (accumulation)
- Derivative: instant rate of change at the limit
- Integral: total accumulated area under a curve
- Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: Derivative & Integral are each others inverse. (taking the derivative of an integral to it's limit gives the original function back)

## Multi-variable calculus
- Same as Calculus but now differentiating or integrating with respect to multiple variables (eg a 2D plane)

## Differential equations
- Describes how a function changes.
- Can be taken at increasingly higher orders:
- The differential of Position is Velocity (1st order)
- The differential of Velocity is Acceleration (2nd order)
- The differential of Acceleration is Jerk (3rd order)
- ...	

Differential equations come up in fluid simulation & physics effects.
For example, when calculating the how much velocity flowed into a cell, we take the integral of the velocity over the distance between two cells. (v / dx)

## Linear Algebra
- Vectors, Matrices, Transforming Coordinate systems

## Geometry
- Lines, Shapes, Triangles, Circles, Volume, Area, Perimeter, ...


# Notation
- x : scalar
- *x* : vector
- X : Matrix
- I : Identity Matrix
- Σ : Summation (for loop, adding values over X iterations)
- Π : Product (for loop, multiplying value sover X iterations)
