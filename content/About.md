## About
![Alt text](../AboutAssets/me.jpg "200px")

My name is Quentin Warnant,

I’m a Senior Rendering Programmer at Rare – XBox Game Studios. In this role I have contributed to Everwild, Sea of Thieves and internal R&D projects. oh - and I'm from Belgium! (land of best chocolates)

My main area of interests and expertise are GPU simulations to enhance players immersion in virtual worlds through increased levels of interactivity. I'm a keen collaborator with VFX & Tech-Art departments and also champion performance optimisations within the studio.

Previously I also worked on Gameplay, UI, backend, tools & plugin systems on mobile games.

I'm comfortable with low level GPU concepts, shaders writing, C++, C# & Python, as well as Unreal Engine and Unity3D.I also enjoy offering mentorship to junior team members.

I've touched on all parts of the development cycled, from prototyping to release and post-release regular updates. I've lead small teams to deliver features and content on time, and taken on the scrum master role. I've driven the recruitment process to grow multiple studios to grow from 10 to 50+ , personally performing selection, code test review and interviews to select the best technical & cultural fits to our teams.

I've released games on a variety of platforms, including mobile, VR, PC and console.

I enjoy being active outdoors by playing tennis, running, snowboarding, rollerblading, scuba-diving & going for a bike ride
