This effect was used in the Age of Sigmar: Realm War game, for lightning arcs. It's made of a pre-tesselated tube mesh, and then later distorted in the vertex shader, using multiple layers of noise, also named Fractal Brownian Motion.

Amplitude and frequency can be tweaked to generate different results.
