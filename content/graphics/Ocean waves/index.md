This effect implements ocean waves using Tessendorf's [paper](https://people.computing.clemson.edu/~jtessen/reports/papers_files/coursenotes2004.pdf), using the Fast Fourrier Transform. This [Tutorial](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/qM1o/unreal-engine-ocean-simulation) was extremely useful to implement it.

The same technique was used in Sea of Thieves, for it's ocean waves - except it wasn't implemented in Niagara.

Prior to that implementation, I also implemented without the tutorial mentioned above, in  Unity3D, although it visually doesn't shine as much, it did functionally just the same
