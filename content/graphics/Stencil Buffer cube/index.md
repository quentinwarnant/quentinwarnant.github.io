This is a fun effect exploring the utility of the stencil buffer, to mask out certain geometry, if the invisible quads on the faces of the cube doesn't match the geometry inside the cube.

I was inspired by the game Antichamber's use of this effect to create interesting puzzles and rooms to navigate.
