I made this effect during a Genuary prompt, in shadertoy [Link](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3ltyDl)
Each part is programmatically generated.

First starting by composing this image through code
![Alt text](Genuary9_Interferences_original.png "400px")

And then producing this ripple interference effect, that is used to displace the UV sampling of the image above.
