I had the chance the work with PlayStation's proprietary game engine during my masters course, the Phyre Engine.
Unlike the popular customer engines of today, a lot had to be stood up by ourselves as a student group. One of my main responsabilities was the rendering part of the engine, and integrate it with our game codebase.
