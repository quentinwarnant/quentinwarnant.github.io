The concept of the Lorenz Attractor captured my interest, it comes from Chaos Theory. The path along the shape is determined by partial differential equations, and is deterministic. However any small changes in  inputs causes large differences in outputs, reminding us of the butterfly effect, which incidentally the Lorenz attractor can look like the shape of it.
