### Description
Ponyvasion is the first Game Jam I participated in, which was organised by big fans of the “My Little Pony” universe, with the Jam theme being “Chaos”. It’s a simple space invader like game where pony’s and unicorns fall from the sky and your goal is to shoot the pony’s with ridiculous weapons like missiles, bananas, forks, etc.

_it wasn't particularly well received by genuine fans of the franchise_ 🤭

### Role: Programming, Art & Design
I worked on it for about 10 hours, all by myself doing the programming and 3D modelling.

#### Platforms:
PC
