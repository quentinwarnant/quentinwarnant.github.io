### Description
I don't remember much about making this game tbh... but it was a solo uni project, using Flash and deployed on mobile phone. It's a sort of space invader like game with a bit more control over where your ship goes, as waves of asteroids and bonus items come down the screen.

### Role: Programmer 

#### Platforms:
- Android
