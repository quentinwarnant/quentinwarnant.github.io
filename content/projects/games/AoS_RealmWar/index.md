### Description
Experience exciting, tactical, PvP multiplayer arena battles with stunning visuals and audio based on the epic fantasy universe, Warhammer Age of Sigmar.

### Role: Senior Gameplay Engineer

#### Contributions
I lead part of the team to implement new units on a regular basis for montly updates, with new abilites and visual features. In this role I served both a lead gameplay engineer, scrum master and managed priorities with other disciplines like Art & Design, to deliver the content on time and on quality. I also worked on graphics effects, and the adoption of PBR material. Prior to initial release I established a scalable process to develop new units, using behaviour trees and composition-based design.
