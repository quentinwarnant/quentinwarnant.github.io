		My name is Quentin Warnant,<br />
		<br />
		I’m a Video-Game Programmer at Rare – Xbox Game Studios, Currently working on graphics & gameplay on Everwild
		and I’m originally from Belgium.<br />
		<br />
		My main area of interests and expertise are Graphics programming and Gameplay systems. I also have experience
		working on UI, backend, tools & plugin systems.<br />
		<br />
		In my role I deliver advanced Graphics features, Gameplay mechanics, utilising C++, C# & Unreal or Unity3D‘s
		game engine and offer mentorship to junior team members.<br />
		<br />
		I also have experience with OpenGL, GLSL, Processing 3, Javascript, NoSQL, Git, Perforce.<br />
		<br />
		During my stints at Sumo Digital and Pixel Toys I helped both studios grow from sub 10 employees to 50+ and have
		held key roles from prototype to release and post-release regular content updates. I lead small teams to deliver
		important
		new features and content on time. Including the technical specificities of iOS, Android & other platform
		submission processes, Build pipelines including build machines, scrum master, and more; I’m flexible to the
		requirements of the situations and team.<br />
		<br />
		A selection of games I worked on can be found on the “Games” portfolio page, and include:<br />
		<ul>
			<li>Sonic Dash</li>
			<li>Warhammer 40K: Freeblade</li>
			<li>Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Realm War</li>
			<li>Drop Dead</li>
			<li>NBA TopShot</li>

		</ul>
		Across platforms such as iOS, Android, Oculus Rift/GearVR, WebGL, Windows Store and more.<br />
		<br />
		At Sumo I have worked on Pass the Punch, porting the unreleased console version to mobile. This included
		intensive memory optimisation, control revamping for touch screen, and platform specific feature support. Having
		been the project lead engineer during this R&D phase I managed the priorities & mentored more junior engineers
		to produce a vertical slice of the experience on touch screen. unannounced Sumo projects.<br />
		<br />
		Aside from “work”, my passion for video games and development doesn’t stop as I have worked on a number of hobby
		projects, both by myself and within teams for personal learning or as part of game jams.<br />
		<br />
		I enjoy rock climbing, snowboarding, rollerblading, scuba-diving & going for a bike ride<br />
		<br /><br />
		Education<br />
		In 2014, I completed a Master’s degree in Video Game Development with Distinction, at the Gamer Camp course at
		Birmingham City University, UK.<br />
		<br />
		In 2013, I completed a Bachelor’s degree with Distinction (1st) in Computer Science – with multi-media modules,
		at the Erasmus Hogeschool, Brussels, Belgium.<br />
		<br />
		Prior to university I studied at the Sint-Lukas art school also in Brussels, where I specialised in architecture
		and design. This gives me a bonus understanding and appreciation for the art production when working with
		artists.<br />
