		<h3>Role: Senior Rendering Engineer</h3>
		My role on the project was to both support th VFX & Tech art teams in delivering visual effects and take large
		rendering systems from inception to delivery and maintenance.
		Topics included:<br />
		<ul>
			<li>Advanced ambient creatures (GPU particles)</li>
			<li>Dynamic foliage interaction</li>
			<li>Fluid simulations</li>
			<li>Physics simulation</li>
			<li>Volumetric clouds</li>
			<li>Rain with occlusion</li>
			<li>Matetial LODs</li>
			<li>etc</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		I also championned performance, by frequently reviewing the title's performance
		profile, identifying areas to improve and either addressing them myself or finding the right individuals to
		own that work. In this capacity I also hosted regular catch-ups with department leads and other stakeholders to
		discuss, generate and prioritise this work.
		I relied on profiling tools such as PIX, Nvidia Nsight and Unreal Insights, to identify
		bottlenecks and optimise them away, as well as inform colleagues of suboptimal patterns to avoid going forwards.

		This was Rare's first experience with Unreal Engine 5, I played a key role in adopting new technologies like
		Nanite, Lumen, Virtual Shadow Maps and guiding the content teams with best practices.
