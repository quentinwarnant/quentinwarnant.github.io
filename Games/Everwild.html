		<h2>Role</h2>
		<p>Senior Rendering Engineer</p>
		My role on the project was to support and VFX & Tech art teams in achieving visual effects, such as:<br />
		<ul>
			<li>Advanced ambient creatures (GPU particles)</li>
			<li>Dynamic foliage interaction</li>
			<li>Fluid simulations</li>
			<li>Volumetric clouds</li>
			<li>Rain with occlusion</li>
			<li>etc</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		On this project I also championned performance optimisation, by frequently reviewing the performance
		profile, identifying areas to improve and either addressing them myself or finding the right individuals to
		own that work. In this capacity I also hosted regular catch-ups with department leads and other stakeholders to
		discuss, generate and prioritise this work.
		In this capacity I relied on profiling tools such as PIX, Nvidia Nsight and Unreal Insights, to identify
		bottlenecks and optimise them away, as well as inform colleagues of suboptimal patterns to avoid going forwards.

		This was Rare's first experience with Unreal Engine 5. I played a key role in adopting new technologies like
		Nanite, Lumen, Virtual Shadow Maps and guiding the content teams with best practices.
