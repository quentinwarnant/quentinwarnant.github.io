	<h1>Untitled NBA Mobile Game</h1>

		<h3>Role: Senior programmer</h3>
		<p>I headed the prototyping of this game, heading a small team in developig the core game logic and hoop
			shooting logic.
			I also developed graphics systems to efficient render animated crowds using vertex animation textures,
			enable visual variety and integrate
			efficient SDF-based shadows to attenuate the model's lighting.
			As a mobile game, a key factor was to support low-spec mobile devices whilst developing these systems.
			I also developed a system to dynamically customisation player jerseys to feature their names and numbers.
		</p>

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This cancelled game was an officially licensed NBA mobile game, which integrated the NBA Top Shot
			collectibles as part of it's meta game.
			Players would play quick time events to shoot hoops and avoid blocks from other players on the court.
			Featuring an async online multiplayer component.
